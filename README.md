Starter project with Django and React

This is mainly a practice project to get more familiar with Python and Django framework. I will be integrating React.js as the frontend. 

This project was created following a video course on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j

As I finish this course, I will look to extending it with my own features. Stay tuned for updates

For lesson 4, the React Router for updated as for 2022 so I updated the code to work correctly.
